# Cosmic_Ray_Muon_Detection_and_Tracking
This project implements a cosmic ray muon tracker using a 25 cm plastic scintillator bar with dual-ended SiPM readout. It includes Geant4 simulations for system optimization and Python code for data analysis from both an oscilloscope and a custom ASIC. The work evaluates various position reconstruction methods, with multiple linear regression achieving a best spatial resolution of 1.54 cm.
